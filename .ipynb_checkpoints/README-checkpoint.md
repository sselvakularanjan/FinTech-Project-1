# Project-1

## To do List

1. Finish automated coronovirus data feed
1. Finish correlation analysis of China and US versus coronoavirus data
1. Create a simulation if the virus continues growing at the same rates
1. Visualizations that tell the story
1. Algorithm for determining when to trade (use bins to determine if the virus is growing stronger or weaker. Use this as a signal to buy in at market low)
1. Forecast if virus continues at same rate
1. Sectors that are growing
1. Calculate Beta for portfolios - use zipline
1. Final presentation slides

1. Once Corona virus data is compiled we can use the bin function to bin together death ratio to sell off
and recovery ratio to sell off (daily) this will give us 2 signals. Sell off and Buy in.
